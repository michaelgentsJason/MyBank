# MyBank Cryptographic Security System

## Overview

MyBank Cryptographic Security System is a comprehensive banking security solution implementing advanced cryptographic techniques to protect sensitive financial data, ensure transaction integrity, and provide secure authentication for online banking operations.

This system addresses the critical security requirements of modern financial institutions by implementing secure channels for communication, robust encryption for data protection, sophisticated key management, multi-factor authentication, and data integrity verification mechanisms.

## Key Security Features

### 1. Data Encryption
- **AES-256-GCM** encryption for sensitive customer data
- Encrypted storage of personally identifiable information
- Protected transaction details with symmetric encryption
- Secure storage of encrypted data in database

### 2. Secure Communication
- **TLS/HTTPS** implementation with certificate management
- End-to-end encrypted messaging between users and bank staff
- Digital signatures for message authenticity verification
- Secure API endpoints with authentication protection

### 3. Key Management System
- Centralized encryption key lifecycle management
- Automatic key rotation mechanisms
- Secure key storage with separation from application code
- Support for both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography

### 4. Multi-Factor Authentication
- Bcrypt password hashing with salting
- Time-based one-time password (TOTP) support
- JWT token-based session management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### 5. Transaction Integrity
- HMAC-SHA256 for transaction verification
- Blockchain implementation for immutable transaction records
- Digital signatures for transaction non-repudiation
- Transaction verification API for integrity checks

## Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture pattern:

- **Blockchain**: Immutable ledger for transaction verification
- **Permission**: Role-based access control implementation

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Cryptography Libraries**:
  - cryptography (Fernet implementation)
  - bcrypt (Password hashing)
  - PyJWT (Token management)
  - hashlib/hmac (Message authentication)
- **Security**: TLS/SSL, HTTPS

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- MySQL Server
- SSL Certificate (self-signed for development, trusted for production)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mybank-security.git
cd mybank-security
```

2. Set up virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure environment
```bash
# Edit config settings
# Create MySQL database
```

4. Initialize database
```bash
python init_db.py
```

5. Generate certificates (for development)
```bash
python scripts/generate_cert.py
```

6. Create default roles
```bash
python scripts/create_roles.py
```

## Usage Examples

### Secure User Authentication

```python
# 1. User login with credentials
login_response = await auth_service.login(username="johnsmith", password="secure_password")

# 2. Verify MFA code
mfa_result = await auth_service.verify_mfa(login_response.temp_token, "123456")

# 3. Use JWT token for authenticated requests
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {mfa_result.token}"}
```

### Encrypted Transaction Processing

```python
# Creating an encrypted and signed transaction
transaction = await transaction_service.create_transaction(
    from_account_id=sender_account.id,
    to_account_id=recipient_account.id,
    amount=Decimal("1000.00"),
    description="Confidential payment for services"  # Will be encrypted
)

# Verifying transaction integrity
verification = blockchain_instance.verify_transaction(transaction.transaction_id)
assert verification["is_valid"] == True
```

### Secure Messaging

```python
# Sending encrypted message
message = await message_service.send_message(
    sender_id=staff.user_id,
    recipient_id=customer.user_id,
    subject="Account Information",
    content="Your new account details are: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"  # Will be encrypted
)

# Reading decrypted message
decrypted_message = await message_service.read_message(message.message_id, customer.user_id)
```

## Security Considerations

- **Production Deployment**: Always use trusted SSL certificates
- **Key Management**: Implement hardware security modules (HSM) for production
- **Regular Updates**: Keep all cryptographic libraries up-to-date
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular security audits
- **Logging**: Implement comprehensive security event logging
- **Compliance**: Ensure alignment with financial regulations (PCI DSS, GDPR, etc.)
